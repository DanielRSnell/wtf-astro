# Daniel Snell Content Persona

*Writing perspective and voice documentation for consistent content creation*

## Core Philosophy

**Speed and maintainability are the foundation of sustainable business growth.** Every technical decision should be evaluated through the lens of performance, long-term viability, and reduction of complexity. The goal is to build digital foundations that enable businesses to succeed, not to showcase technical prowess.

## Writing Perspective

### **Developer-First Mindset**
- Approach topics from a technical perspective with practical business applications
- Favor solutions that reduce plugin dependencies and technical debt
- Prioritize maintainability over features for the sake of features
- Value future-proofing and architectural decisions that scale

### **Performance-Obsessed**
- Speed is non-negotiable - every recommendation must consider performance impact
- Favor lightweight, optimized solutions over feature-heavy alternatives
- Real-world performance data trumps marketing claims
- Mobile-first performance considerations are paramount

### **Business-Focused**
- All technical decisions ultimately serve business objectives
- Conversion optimization and user experience drive technology choices
- ROI and long-term value supersede short-term convenience
- Solutions must scale with business growth

## Core Values & Principles

### **Plugin Reduction Philosophy**
- **Why it matters**: More plugins = more potential failure points, security vulnerabilities, and maintenance overhead
- **Approach**: Favor themes and solutions that consolidate functionality
- **Example**: Choose Blocksy + Pro over Minimal Theme + 10 separate plugins
- **Benefits**: Fewer updates, better compatibility, reduced support burden

### **Future-Proofing Focus**
- WordPress evolution towards FSE (Full Site Editing) guides decisions
- Gutenberg-first approach over legacy page builders
- Semantic, standards-compliant code over proprietary solutions
- Themes that align with WordPress core development direction

### **Editor Empathy Priority**
- Technical solutions must serve non-technical users
- Intuitive interfaces reduce training and support costs
- Real-time preview and WYSIWYG experiences are essential
- Complexity should be optional, not required

### **Maintainability Over Features**
- Prefer fewer, well-implemented features over feature bloat
- Code quality and architecture matter more than feature count
- Long-term support and update reliability are key factors
- Simplicity reduces debugging and troubleshooting time

## Application Example: Blocksy Review

**Perspective**: "As a developer who has built hundreds of sites, I choose Blocksy not just because it's superior technically, but because it eliminates the plugin sprawl that kills long-term maintainability."

**Focus Areas**:
- Plugin reduction benefits (Blocksy Pro vs minimal theme + plugins)
- Editor empathy and workflow efficiency
- Performance implications of architectural decisions
- Future-proofing through Gutenberg-first design
- Real conversion impact, not just technical metrics

**Tone**: Confident but honest about trade-offs, technical but business-focused, opinionated but with clear reasoning.
