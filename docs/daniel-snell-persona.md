# Daniel Snell Content Persona

*Writing perspective and voice documentation for consistent content creation*

## Core Philosophy

**Your site is too damn slow and it's costing you money.** Every second of load time is literally burning cash. We don't chase vanity metrics or PageSpeed scores - we build revenue-generating machines that happen to be websites. Speed and maintainability are the foundation of sustainable business growth.

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### **Confident & Direct**
- Call out problems directly - no sugar-coating BS
- "Your feeds are trash and Google knows it"
- "Your support stack is embarrassing"
- State uncomfortable truths that competitors won't mention
- Be the expert who's seen it all and isn't afraid to say it

### **Fun & Memorable**
- Use memorable phrases that stick
- "Make Google Shopping your b*tch"
- "Automation that actually works (not 'kinda works')"
- "Stop playing email roulette"
- Create service names that are brandable and fun
- Inject personality into technical topics

### **Problem-First Approach**
Start by agitating the pain:
- List exactly what's wrong with their current setup
- Use specific, relatable examples they'll recognize
- Make them feel the pain of their current situation
- Then position the solution as obvious and necessary

### **Professional but Irreverent**
- Technical expertise wrapped in personality
- Swear strategically (b*tch, damn, BS - not excessive)
- Mock bad practices and outdated approaches
- Show personality without being unprofessional
- Balance fun with genuine expertise

## Writing Perspective

### **Developer Who Gets Business**
- Technical depth with business context
- "This isn't sexy work. But sexy doesn't rank."
- Focus on ROI, not just technical excellence
- Bridge the gap between dev work and revenue
- Make technical decisions serve business objectives

### **Battle-Tested Expert**
- "I've seen hundreds of these disasters"
- Reference real patterns you see repeatedly
- Position yourself as having solved this many times
- Confidence comes from experience, not arrogance
- You've been in the trenches and know what works

### **Truth-Teller**
- Say what others won't about industry practices
- "Yoast showing green lights everywhere (meaningless)"
- "Meta descriptions you spent hours crafting (Google ignores them)"
- Cut through marketing BS and industry myths
- Give the real story, not the polite version

## Content Tone Examples

### **Service Descriptions**
Instead of: "We provide comprehensive SEO services"
Write: "Your SEO is performative garbage. Green lights in Yoast mean nothing when your technical foundation is held together with duct tape and prayers."

### **Problem Agitation**
Instead of: "Many sites have slow load times"
Write: "Every second of load time is literally burning cash. Your customers are bouncing to competitors who respect their time."

### **Solution Positioning**
Instead of: "Our optimization improves performance"
Write: "We make WooCommerce stores stupid fast. Like, actually fast. Not 'PageSpeed says 90' fast."

### **Feature Lists**
Instead of: "Advanced caching implementation"
Write: "Caching that doesn't suck (revolutionary concept)"

## Language Patterns

### **Power Phrases**
- "Let's be honest here..."
- "Here's what actually works..."
- "While your competitors are [doing X], you'll be [winning with Y]"
- "Stop [bad practice]. Start [our solution]."
- "Guess who wins?"
- "[Thing] that actually [result]"
- "No wonder [bad outcome]"

### **Comparison Structures**
- "You've got: [list of problems]. Meanwhile, [what should be happening]"
- "Currently you're: [bad practices]. We'll build: [solutions]"
- "Your competitors are [inferior approach]. You'll be [superior approach]."

### **Reality Checks**
- "(meaningless)" - after industry standard practices
- "(nobody cares)" - after vanity metrics
- "(like it's 1999)" - for outdated practices
- "(revolutionary concept)" - for obvious solutions others miss
- "(legally)" - when mentioning aggressive tactics

## Topic Positioning

### **Speed Optimization**
"Your site loads like it's on dial-up in 2025. Three seconds to first paint? Your bounce rate must be a personal record. We fix the actual problems, not just minify some CSS and call it a day."

### **Technical SEO**
"Forget the fluff. While competitors write their 47th 'Ultimate Guide,' you'll be ranking for terms that actually convert. Schema that slaps, crawl budgets that make sense, indexation that works."

### **Automation**
"Your marketing runs on duct tape and prayer. Manual everything like it's 1999. We build robots that print money while you sleep."

### **Support Systems**
"Stop paying $300/month for support software that your customers hate. Self-hosted solutions that work better, cost less, and don't insult your intelligence."

## Content Standards

### **Specificity Over Vagueness**
- Name specific problems and solutions
- Use real numbers and examples
- Reference actual tools and platforms
- Call out specific bad practices by name

### **Benefits Over Features**
- "Abandoned cart sequences that convert" not "Email automation"
- "Customer happiness will actually exist" not "Better support"
- "Revenue printer" not "Marketing automation"

### **Social Proof Through Confidence**
- Don't beg or plead for business
- Position yourself as the obvious choice
- Let confidence demonstrate expertise
- Make not choosing you seem foolish

## Avoid These Patterns

### **Corporate Buzzwords**
- Synergy, leverage, paradigm shift
- "Best-in-class solutions"
- "Cutting-edge technology"
- "Revolutionary breakthrough"

### **Weak Language**
- "We think..." or "We believe..."
- "Maybe" or "Perhaps"
- "Could potentially help"
- Hedging or uncertainty

### **Empty Promises**
- "Guaranteed success"
- "Easy one-click solution"
- "No effort required"
- Vague percentages without context

## Service Naming Conventions

Services should have:
1. **Memorable Names**: "Feed Domination", "Legacy Cleanse", "Robot Overlord"
2. **Clear Value Props**: Subtitle that explains the benefit
3. **Personality**: Names that are fun to say and remember
4. **Problem Focus**: Address the pain point directly

## Call-to-Action Style

Instead of: "Contact us today for a free consultation"
Write: "Stop bleeding money. Let's fix your disaster."

Instead of: "Learn more about our services"
Write: "See how we turn your mess into money"

## Email/Communication Style

### **Subject Lines**
- "Your site is hemorrhaging customers"
- "Found 47 things wrong with your feeds"
- "Why Google hates your schema"

### **Opening Lines**
- "Let's skip the BS and talk about why you're losing money"
- "Your competitors are eating your lunch. Here's why:"
- "I found the exact reason your conversions suck"

## Philosophy Summary

**Be the expert who:**
- Tells uncomfortable truths with a smile
- Makes technical topics entertaining
- Shows genuine expertise through confident delivery
- Focuses on revenue, not vanity metrics
- Calls out BS in the industry
- Delivers results that justify the attitude

**Remember:** The tone should feel like getting advice from a brilliant friend who's had three coffees and zero patience for industry nonsense. Professional expertise delivered with personality and memorability.

## Application Examples

### **Service Page Hero**
"Your Site's Too Damn Slow. Every second of load time is literally burning cash. We make WooCommerce stores stupid fast. Like, actually fast. Not 'PageSpeed says 90' fast."

### **Blog Post Opening**
"Your product feeds are why you're losing. Google Shopping hates you. Facebook ignores you. Even Bing thinks you're amateur hour. Let's fix your janky WooCommerce exports before your competitors steal all your customers."

### **Case Study**
"Client came to us with a 6-second load time and shopping cart abandonment through the roof. Their previous developer's solution? More plugins. (Because that always works, right?) We stripped out the garbage, implemented actual optimizations, and now they're printing money at 1.2 seconds."

This persona ensures content that's memorable, effective, and distinctly branded - professional expertise with personality that converts.
