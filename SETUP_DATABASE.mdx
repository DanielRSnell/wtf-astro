# 🛠️ Database Setup Instructions

The authentication system is ready but needs the database schema to be created in Supabase.

## ⚡ Quick Setup

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ugqbxwlsnqkxyqcheygf

2. **Open SQL Editor**: Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

3. **Create New Query**: Click "New Query"

4. **Copy & Paste**: Copy the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql` and paste it into the SQL editor

5. **Run the Query**: Click "RUN" to execute the schema

## ✅ What This Creates

- **`profiles` table**: Stores user profile data and roles
- **User roles**: subscriber, author, editor, admin (hierarchical permissions)
- **Automatic profile creation**: New users get a profile automatically
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only see/edit their own profiles (admins can see all)
- **Triggers**: Auto-update timestamps and profile creation

## 🧪 Test the Setup

After running the SQL schema:

1. **Sign up a new user** on your site
2. **Check the profiles table** in Supabase dashboard under "Table Editor"
3. **You should see** the new user profile with default role "subscriber"

## 🚨 Current Error

You're seeing this error because the profiles table doesn't exist yet:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
Error fetching profile: Object
```

This will be fixed once you run the SQL schema in your Supabase dashboard.

## 🔧 Fixed SQL Schema

The SQL schema has been updated to fix the `missing FROM-clause entry for table "old"` error. The updated schema includes:
- Proper role change protection via triggers instead of policies
- Enhanced security for role management
- All necessary functions and permissions

## 🔧 After Setup

Once the database is set up, the authentication will work perfectly:
- ✅ User registration with automatic profile creation
- ✅ Role-based permissions (subscriber → author → editor → admin)
- ✅ User initials display in navigation when logged in
- ✅ Secure logout and session management
