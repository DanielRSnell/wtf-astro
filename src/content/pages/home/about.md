mission:
  paragraphs:
    - "Financial services have changed, are changing, and will continue to change — for the better. Now is the time for finance to be developer-first and API-driven. But in order to do this — it needs a new foundation."
    - "We were always told that banks can't be platforms."
    - "Everyone tried fixing the problem by layering APIs on legacy systems, creating abstractions and inefficiencies. We have spent years building and scaling companies like Plaid, Stripe, and Affirm, confronting these limitations firsthand. The current solutions aren't good enough. We believe that banking infrastructure must be reimagined as an API platform. But we had to start from ground zero."
