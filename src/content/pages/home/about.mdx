  paragraphs:
    - "I specialize in early-stage high growth. Having built multiple companies from zero to acquisition, I understand the unique challenges of creating something from nothing. I wasn't hired to maintain success — I was brought in to create it. From product-market fit to scaling operations, I've done it all."
    - "With 7 successful exits across SaaS, mobile, and ecommerce, I've proven that sustainable growth isn't luck — it's a repeatable process built on technical excellence and strategic thinking."
    - "Now I'm bringing those same growth frameworks to WooCommerce. Every store owner deserves access to enterprise-level strategies and systems. Your business might be smaller, but your ambitions don't have to be."

    - "Our approach is built on real startup experience. We know that early-stage success requires different strategies than maintaining mature products. We implement proven growth frameworks, performance optimizations, and scaling strategies that have driven multiple billion-dollar acquisitions."
    - "Growth isn't luck — it's a system. We've built and refined that system through 7 successful exits."
    - "Every WooCommerce store we optimize benefits from battle-tested methodologies. The same processes that scale startups to acquisition, that transform unknown brands into market leaders — these aren't secrets, they're repeatable systems. And now they're working for you."

  title: "Meet the Snell Family"
  description: "Hi, I'm Daniel — father of six, early stage specialist, and founder of WooThatsFast. I've built companies from the ground up, resulting in 7 successful acquisitions. I was there in the trenches, figuring out product-market fit, building the first systems, and scaling from dozens to millions of users. With six kids at home, I understand what it means to build something that lasts. Now I'm bringing those same growth strategies to WooCommerce, because every business deserves access to proven playbooks — not just Silicon Valley insiders."
