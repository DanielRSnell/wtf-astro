## Speed Kills (Your Competition)

Every second your site takes to load, you're literally burning money. Here's the math:
- 1 second delay = 7% fewer conversions
- 2 seconds = 14% gone
- 3 seconds = might as well close shop

Your WooCommerce store is probably committing every speed sin in the book. We're here to absolve you.

## The Speed Treatment

We don't just slap a cache plugin on and call it optimization. We go deep:

1. **Database Surgery** - 500 queries? Let's make it 50
2. **Image Therapy** - Your 5MB hero image needs an intervention
3. **Plugin Detox** - 47 plugins? Really? REALLY?
4. **Code Rehab** - That pagebuilder has to go

Your store will load so fast, customers won't have time to reconsider their purchase.
