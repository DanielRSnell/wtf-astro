## Your Ads Are a Money Fire

The brutal truth:
- Google Shopping: Disapproved or invisible
- Facebook: $150 to sell a $40 product
- Remarketing: "What's that?"
- Attribution: "I think it's working?"

You're competing against agencies with million-dollar budgets and AI-powered bidding. With your DIY campaigns and "set it and forget it" strategy. Good luck with that.

## Ecommerce Advertising That Works

We only do ecommerce. We only do what works:

1. **Product Listing Ads (PLAs)** - Dominate Google Shopping results
2. **Dynamic Remarketing** - Stalk visitors across the internet (legally)
3. **Social Commerce** - Facebook, Instagram, TikTok shops that convert
4. **Marketplace Ads** - Amazon, Walmart, eBay - fish where the fish are

Every campaign optimized for one thing: profit. Not clicks, not impressions, not "brand awareness." Money.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

- Average ROAS: 4.2x (you spend $1, get $4.20 back)
- PLA conversion rates: 3.5% (industry average: 1.91%)
- Remarketing recovery: 18% of abandoned carts
- CAC reduction: 40-60% in first 90 days

We don't do vanity metrics. We do bank deposits. If your ads don't profit in 90 days, full refund. That's how confident we are.
