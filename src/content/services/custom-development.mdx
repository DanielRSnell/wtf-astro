## The Problem with Off-the-Shelf Solutions

Most WooCommerce stores are built on:
- **Bloated multipurpose themes** with 50+ features you'll never use
- **Dozens of plugins** each adding their own CSS/JS
- **Pagebuilders** that generate 10x more code than needed
- **Generic templates** not optimized for your specific needs

Result? Slow sites that all look the same and convert poorly.

## Custom Development Done Right

I build WooCommerce solutions from scratch, focused on:

### Performance First
- Every line of code is necessary
- No unused features or bloat
- Optimized database queries from day one
- Minimal HTTP requests

### Built for YOUR Business
- Custom user flows based on your customers
- Features specific to your products
- Integrations with your existing tools
- Scalable architecture for growth

### Maintainable Code
- Following WordPress coding standards
- Properly documented
- Update-proof implementation
- No dependency hell

## What I Build

### Custom WooCommerce Themes
Forget ThemeForest. Get a theme built specifically for your store:
- Designed around your products
- Optimized checkout flow
- Mobile-first approach
- No pagebuilder needed
- Gutenberg blocks for easy editing

### Custom Plugins
Stop stacking plugins that conflict with each other:
- Single plugin for multiple features
- Lightweight and fast
- Exactly what you need, nothing more
- Professional admin interfaces

### WooCommerce Extensions
Extend WooCommerce without the bloat:
- Custom product types
- Specialized shipping methods
- Unique checkout experiences
- Advanced inventory management
- Custom reporting

## Development Philosophy

### 1. Understand Before Building
I don't start coding until I understand:
- Your business model
- Your customer journey
- Your growth plans
- Your technical requirements

### 2. Build for Speed
Performance isn't an afterthought:
- Optimize as we build
- Minimize database queries
- Efficient asset loading
- Smart caching strategies

### 3. Test Everything
Before launch:
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing
- Load testing
- Security auditing
- User acceptance testing

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript** when possible (no jQuery dependency)
- **Modern CSS** with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Optimized images** with srcset and lazy loading
- **Web fonts** loaded efficiently

### Backend
- **Custom PHP** following WordPress standards
- **Optimized database** queries and structure
- **REST API** integration where needed
- **Proper data sanitization** and security

### WooCommerce Specific
- **Custom templates** overriding defaults efficiently
- **AJAX cart** updates without page reloads
- **Streamlined checkout** removing unnecessary fields
- **Smart caching** for dynamic content

## Why Custom Development?

### Cost Effective Long-Term
While initial investment is higher:
- No annual theme/plugin licenses
- Less maintenance required
- Fewer compatibility issues
- Better performance = more sales

### Competitive Advantage
- Unique user experience
- Faster than competitors
- Features they can't copy
- Better conversion rates

### Peace of Mind
- Code you own completely
- No surprise breaking changes
- Professional support available
- Built to last

## Investment Levels

Custom development is an investment in your business's future. Projects typically range:

- **Small customizations**: $1,000 - $3,000
- **Custom plugins**: $2,000 - $10,000
- **Complete themes**: $5,000 - $25,000
- **Full platform builds**: $15,000+

The return on investment comes from:
- Increased conversion rates
- Lower maintenance costs
- Better customer experience
- Competitive advantage

## Not Another Agency

I'm not an agency with junior developers and project managers. When you hire me:
- I personally write the code
- Direct communication throughout
- No middlemen or markup
- Focused on results, not billable hours
