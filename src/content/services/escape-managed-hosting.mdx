## The Great Escape

Managed hosting promised you the world. Instead, you got:
- Support tickets that take 3 days for a copy-paste response
- "Unlimited" everything (except when you actually need it)
- Random downtime at 2am that's somehow your fault
- Pricing that mysteriously doubles every renewal

Sound familiar? Yeah, we thought so.

## Your Escape Plan

We don't just move your files and call it a day. We architect your freedom:

1. **Audit the Prison** - What's actually holding you back?
2. **Plan the Breakout** - Custom infrastructure for YOUR needs
3. **Execute Flawlessly** - Zero-downtime migration
4. **Never Look Back** - Ongoing optimization included

Stop paying $300/month for a fancy control panel. Get actual performance instead.
