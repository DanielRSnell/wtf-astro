## Your Site Needs a Cleanse

That database of yours? It's hoarding:
- 47 deactivated plugins still storing data
- 3 million post revisions from 2018
- Transients that expired during Obama's presidency
- Options from themes you tried once and hated

It's digital hoarding, and it's killing your performance.

## The Cleansing Ritual

We don't just DELETE FROM wp_posts and pray. We're surgical:

1. **Archaeological Dig** - What ancient evils lurk below?
2. **Careful Extraction** - Keep the gold, trash the garbage
3. **Database Optimization** - MyISAM to InnoDB, indexes that actually work
4. **Prevention Plan** - Never let it get this bad again

Your admin panel will load so fast, you'll actually enjoy using WordPress again.
