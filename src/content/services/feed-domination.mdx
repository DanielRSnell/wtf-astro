## Your Feeds Are Why You're Losing

Google Shopping hates you. Facebook ignores you. Instagram thinks you're amateur hour. Bing... yes, even Bing rejects you.

Why? Your product feeds look like they were exported in 2010 and never touched again.

- Titles: "Product_123_Blue_Large_Final_v2"
- Descriptions: Copy-pasted manufacturer BS
- Images: Blurry 400x400 nightmares
- Categories: "Misc > Other > Stuff"

No wonder your ROAS is garbage and your PLAs never show.

## Feed Optimization That Prints Money

We don't just fix your feeds. We weaponize them across every platform that matters:

1. **Google Shopping Domination** - PLAs that show up and convert
2. **Facebook & Instagram Commerce** - Dynamic product ads that work
3. **Remarketing Lists That Slap** - Follow them everywhere (legally)
4. **Bing Shopping** - Yes, Bing. It's free money you're ignoring

Your competitors are using default WooCommerce exports. You'll be using feeds optimized for each platform's algorithm. Guess who wins?

## The Multi-Channel Truth

- **Google PLAs** - Proper GTIN, perfect taxonomy, winning bids
- **Social Commerce** - Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok
- **Remarketing Feeds** - Dynamic ads that stalk (professionally)
- **Comparison Engines** - Dominate price comparisons

Stop letting bad feeds kill your revenue. Every channel, every platform, total domination.
