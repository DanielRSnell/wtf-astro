## Your Support Stack is Embarrassing

Currently you're using:
- Email (lost in spam folder)
- Contact form (goes nowhere)
- Facebook messages (lol)
- That chat widget that never works

Your customers hate you. Not personally, but... yeah, kinda.

## Chatwoot Changes Everything

Real support system that:

1. **Lives Where Customers Are** - Website, WhatsApp, email, wherever
2. **Team Actually Uses** - Because it doesn't require a PhD to operate
3. **Automation Built-in** - Common questions answer themselves
4. **Costs Nothing** - Self-hosted, no per-agent BS

Your support response time will drop from days to minutes. Customer happiness will actually exist.
