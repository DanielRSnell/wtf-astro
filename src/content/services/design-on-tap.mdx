## Your Design Process is Broken

Currently you're:
- Getting quotes for every. single. design.
- Waiting weeks for simple banners
- Paying $500 for one social post
- Using Canva (and it shows)

Meanwhile, you need designs yesterday. Product launches, email campaigns, social posts, ads - the requests never stop. Neither should your designer.

## Unlimited Design, Fixed Cost

How it actually works:

1. **Submit Unlimited Requests** - Trello board, as many as you want
2. **72-Hour Delivery** - Most designs done in 3 days or less
3. **Revisions Included** - Until you love it
4. **One Designer** - Your dedicated pro who learns your brand

No contracts. No surprises. Just designs when you need them.

## What You Actually Get

- Product photography editing
- Video editing & motion graphics
- Email templates & campaigns
- Social media graphics
- Banner ads that convert
- Landing page designs
- Print materials
- Brand guidelines
- Icon sets
- Infographics
- Everything else
