## You're Wasting 3 Hours Daily

Let me guess your morning:
- Copy-paste order data to spreadsheet
- Manually email tracking numbers
- Update inventory across 4 platforms
- Generate the same report Karen needs every Tuesday

That's not running a business. That's data entry hell.

## Enter n8n (Your New Best Friend)

We build automation workflows that:

1. **Connect Everything** - WooCommerce, email, sheets, Slack, whatever
2. **Think For You** - Smart logic that handles edge cases
3. **Scale Infinitely** - 10 orders or 10,000, same effort (zero)
4. **Actually Work** - No Zapier timeout BS here

Imagine actually focusing on growing your business instead of being its data monkey.
