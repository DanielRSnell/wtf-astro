## Your SEO is Performative Garbage

You've got:
- Yoast showing green lights everywhere (meaningless)
- Blog posts about "Top 10 Whatever" (nobody cares)
- Meta descriptions you spent hours crafting (Google ignores them)
- A sitemap (congratulations, so does everyone)

Meanwhile, your technical foundation is held together with duct tape and prayers.

## Real Technical SEO (The Stuff That Works)

Forget the fluff. We fix what matters:

1. **Schema Markup That Slaps** - Rich snippets, FAQ boxes, product cards
2. **Crawl Like You Mean It** - Stop wasting Googlebot's time on garbage pages
3. **Indexation Mastery** - Control what ranks, kill what doesn't
4. **Site Architecture** - Silos that make sense, not SEO vomit

While your competitors are writing their 47th "Ultimate Guide," you'll be ranking for terms that actually convert.

## The Technical Stuff Nobody Talks About

- JavaScript rendering (your React mess is invisible)
- Faceted navigation (duplicate content nightmare)
- International targeting (hreflang is probably broken)
- Log file analysis (what's Google actually doing?)

This isn't sexy work. But sexy doesn't rank. Technical excellence does.
