## Your Marketing Stack is a Joke

You're manually:
- Sending follow-up emails (like it's 1999)
- Segmenting lists in spreadsheets (kill me)
- Running campaigns one at a time (inefficient AF)
- Tracking conversions with guesswork (not data)

Meanwhile, your competitors have robots doing everything. Guess who's winning?

## Marketing Automation That Prints

We build systems that:

1. **Segment Intelligently** - Behavior-based, not "they clicked once"
2. **Nurture Automatically** - Multi-touch sequences that convert
3. **Score Leads Properly** - Know who's ready to buy
4. **Campaign at Scale** - Launch 100 campaigns, manage zero

Your marketing team can finally do marketing instead of data entry. Revolutionary concept.

## The Automations Nobody Tells You About

- Post-purchase upsells (30% revenue boost)
- Win-back campaigns (resurrect dead customers)
- Review automation (5-star army building)
- Inventory alerts (FOMO that works)

Stop playing email roulette. Start printing money with automation that actually works.
