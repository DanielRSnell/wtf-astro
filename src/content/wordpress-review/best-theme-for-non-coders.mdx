## Comparison with Other Beginner Themes

### GeneratePress vs. Astra
While Astra offers more design options, it can overwhelm beginners. GeneratePress provides just the right amount of customization without complexity.

### GeneratePress vs. Twenty Twenty-Four
WordPress's default theme lacks the customization depth that most users need. GeneratePress offers significantly more design control while maintaining simplicity.

### GeneratePress vs. Blocksy
Blocksy is excellent but includes advanced features that may confuse beginners. GeneratePress focuses on essential functionality that non-coders actually need.

## Getting Started Guide

### Step 1: Installation
1. Go to Appearance > Themes in your WordPress admin
2. Click "Add New" and search for "GeneratePress"
3. Install and activate the theme
