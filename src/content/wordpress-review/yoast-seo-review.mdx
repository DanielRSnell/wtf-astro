# Yoast SEO Review: Is the Original Still the Best?

Yoast SEO has been the gold standard for WordPress SEO since 2008. With over 5 million active installations, it's by far the most popular SEO plugin. But popularity doesn't always equal superiority â€“ so how does Yoast hold up in 2024?

## The Yoast Advantage: Simplicity and Trust

What made Yoast successful initially still holds true today. The plugin excels at making SEO accessible to beginners without overwhelming them with options.

## Content Analysis: Where Yoast Shines

The plugin's content analysis feature remains one of its strongest points. The traffic light system makes it easy to understand what needs improvement.

### Readability Analysis
Yoast's readability analysis helps you write content that's not just SEO-friendly, but also user-friendly.

## Where Yoast Falls Short

### Limited Free Features
Compared to newer competitors like RankMath, Yoast's free version feels restrictive.

### Aging Interface
While functional, the interface feels dated compared to modern alternatives.

### Premium Pricing
At $99/year for a single site, Yoast Premium is expensive compared to competitors offering unlimited sites for less.

## The Verdict: Still Good, But No Longer the Best

Yoast SEO remains a solid choice, especially for beginners who value simplicity and reliability. However, for users wanting advanced features and better value, newer alternatives like RankMath offer more bang for your buck.
