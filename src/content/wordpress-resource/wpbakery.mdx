# WPBakery Page Builder - Review Skipped

We're not planning to review WPBakery Page Builder. **Reason:** Outdated technology with severe performance issues. Better modern alternatives available.

## Why We're Skipping This Review

WPBakery (formerly Visual Composer) represents outdated WordPress development practices from the early 2010s. Its shortcode-based architecture and performance issues make it unsuitable for modern websites.

## Known Issues

### Critical Problems
- **Performance:** Adds 500kb+ of CSS/JS on every page
- **Maintenance:** Shortcode architecture makes content unmaintainable
- **Migration:** Nearly impossible to migrate to other solutions
- **Security:** Older versions have known vulnerabilities
- **Mobile:** No proper mobile editing capabilities

## Why It's Still Around

Many ThemeForest themes still bundle WPBakery, creating a lock-in situation for users. Once you build with WPBakery, migrating away requires rebuilding your entire site.

## Better Alternatives

### For Performance
- **GenerateBlocks:** Lightweight, developer-friendly
- **Gutenberg:** Native WordPress solution

### For Visual Building
- **Bricks Builder:** Modern architecture, clean code
- **Breakdance:** From the Oxygen team

### For Simplicity
- **Kadence Blocks:** User-friendly with good performance
- **Stackable:** Gutenberg-based solution

## Our Recommendation

**Avoid WPBakery completely.** If you have an existing site using it, plan a migration to a modern solution. The technical debt and performance impact aren't worth any perceived convenience.

## Red Flags
- Sites using WPBakery typically score 20-40 on PageSpeed
- Content becomes locked in shortcode format
- Updates frequently break layouts
- No meaningful improvements in years

If you're stuck with WPBakery, we recommend hiring a developer to migrate your content to a modern solution.
