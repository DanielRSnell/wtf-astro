# Enfold WordPress Theme Review

Enfold is a business-focused theme from ThemeForest that combines professional designs with drag-and-drop building capabilities, though it shares common marketplace theme limitations.

## Business-Focused Design

Enfold excels at creating professional business websites with clean, modern designs that work well for corporate and service-based businesses.

## Avia Layout Builder

The theme includes its own page builder (Avia Layout Builder) that provides drag-and-drop functionality for creating custom layouts.

## Performance Considerations

Like many ThemeForest themes, Enfold can suffer from performance issues, especially when using complex layouts with the page builder.

## Code Quality

While better than some marketplace themes, Enfold still has the typical code quality issues associated with feature-heavy ThemeForest products.

## Documentation & Support

Enfold provides comprehensive documentation and has an active support community, making it easier for users to get help when needed.

## Professional Appearance

The theme consistently delivers professional-looking results, making it popular among businesses and agencies.

## Final Verdict

Enfold is a solid choice for businesses that need professional designs and are willing to accept typical ThemeForest limitations. Consider performance implications and explore modern alternatives before committing.
