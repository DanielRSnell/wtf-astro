## Coming Soon

This comprehensive review of Perfmatters is currently in development. It will cover:

- **Script Manager Mastery**: Per-page JavaScript and CSS control for maximum optimization
- **Core Web Vitals Excellence**: Real-world FID, LCP, and CLS improvements
- **Unused CSS Removal**: Surgical precision in eliminating bloat without breaking layouts
- **WooCommerce Optimization**: Cart fragment control and checkout performance enhancement
- **Developer Workflow**: API integration, debugging tools, and advanced configurations
- **ROI Analysis**: Performance improvements vs subscription costs for growing businesses

## Key Positioning

Perfmatters represents **surgical precision in WordPress optimization**. While comprehensive plugins offer broad features, Perfmatters provides the granular control needed by technical builders to optimize every aspect of asset loading and script execution.

**Perfect for:** Technical builders and developers, agencies managing high-performance client sites, WooCommerce stores needing maximum optimization, teams focused on Core Web Vitals excellence.

**Consider alternatives when:** You need integrated caching and image optimization, prefer simple interfaces, lack technical optimization knowledge, or want all-in-one solutions.

## The Precision Advantage

Perfmatters' strength lies in providing the exact controls needed to optimize modern WordPress sites for Core Web Vitals, with granular script management that can eliminate performance bottlenecks other plugins can't address.
