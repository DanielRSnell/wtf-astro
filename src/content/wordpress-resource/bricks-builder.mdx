# Bricks Builder - Review In Progress

We're currently testing Bricks Builder. **Status:** Currently conducting performance benchmarks and comparing with other modern builders.

## Testing Progress: 65% Complete

### âœ… Completed Testing
- Initial setup and installation
- Basic performance benchmarks
- Core feature evaluation
- Template system review

### ðŸ”„ Currently Testing
- Advanced performance scenarios
- WooCommerce integration
- Dynamic data capabilities
- Multi-site compatibility

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Tests
- Developer workflow efficiency
- Client handoff process
- Long-term maintenance
- Security audit

## Preliminary Findings

### Performance Metrics
**Test Site:** demo.bricksbuilder.io
- **Mobile PageSpeed:** 94/100
- **Desktop PageSpeed:** 99/100
- **First Contentful Paint:** 0.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint:** 1.2s

### What's Impressive So Far

#### Clean Code Output
Bricks generates remarkably clean HTML without the typical builder bloat. The markup is semantic and accessible.

#### Developer-Friendly Features
- Native CSS grid and flexbox controls
- Custom query loops
- Conditions and dynamic data
- PHP/JS code execution (for developers)

#### Performance First
Unlike most builders, Bricks seems built with performance as a primary concern rather than an afterthought.

### Areas We're Investigating

#### Community Size
The Bricks community is growing but still smaller than established players. We're evaluating the impact on:
- Available tutorials and resources
- Third-party integrations
- Long-term viability

#### Learning Curve
While powerful, Bricks requires more technical knowledge than Elementor. We're assessing the learning curve for different user types.

## Early Impressions

Bricks Builder appears to be what Elementor should have been - a powerful visual builder that doesn't sacrifice performance for features.

### Who It's Looking Good For
- Agencies building client sites
- Developers who want visual tools
- Performance-conscious users
- Those seeking a one-time payment model

### Who Might Want to Wait
- Complete beginners to WordPress
- Users needing extensive third-party addons
- Those requiring 24/7 support
