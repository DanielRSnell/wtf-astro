## Coming Soon

This comprehensive review of GenerateBlocks is currently in development. It will cover:

- **Four Blocks to Rule Them All**: How Container, Grid, Headline, and Button blocks build everything
- **Performance Perfection**: Why 12KB total impact creates unmatched speed
- **Clean Code Philosophy**: Semantic HTML that developers actually want to maintain
- **The Technical Debt Reality**: Why manual repetition creates long-term inefficiency
- **GeneratePress Integration**: The complete performance-focused WordPress stack
- **When It Makes Sense**: Technical builder scenarios where it excels

## Key Positioning

GenerateBlocks represents **code purity over convenience**. While it produces the cleanest output and best performance scores, it requires rebuilding fundamental patterns on every project. It's the choice for technical builders who prioritize code quality over development velocity.

**Perfect for:** Technical builders who write CSS/HTML, performance-critical projects, minimalist design approaches, long-term maintainable sites.

**Consider alternatives when:** You need visual editing tools, want premade templates, have non-technical team members, or prioritize development speed over code purity.

## The Honest Assessment

**GenerateBlocks would be my top pick for technical audiencesâ€”if Greenshift and Greenlight didn't exist.** It's excellent for code purists but creates inefficiency through manual repetition. The clean output comes at the cost of development velocity.
