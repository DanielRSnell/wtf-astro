## What is Laravel Herd?

Laravel Herd is a blazing-fast, native development environment for macOS and Windows. Unlike traditional tools that rely on virtual machines or Docker, Herd runs natively on your system, providing:

- **Lightning Speed**: Native performance without virtualization overhead
- **Multiple PHP Versions**: Switch between PHP versions with a single click
- **Built-in Services**: MySQL, Redis, Meilisearch, and more (Pro version)
- **SSL Certificates**: Automatic SSL for all local sites
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box

### Why Choose Herd for WordPress?

While Herd was initially built for Laravel, it's perfect for WordPress development:

1. **Speed**: Sites load instantly, no more waiting for Docker containers
2. **Simplicity**: No complex configurations or YAML files
3. **Reliability**: Native services mean fewer compatibility issues
4. **Professional Features**: Production-like environment locally

## Understanding Herd's Architecture

### How Herd Works

Herd uses a unique architecture that combines:

1. **Native PHP Binaries**: Pre-compiled PHP versions optimized for your system
2. **Nginx Web Server**: High-performance web server
3. **dnsmasq**: Local DNS resolution for .test domains
4. **Service Manager**: Coordinates all services

### Directory Structure

```
~/Herd/
├── config/           # Herd configuration files
├── services/         # Service configurations
├── sites/            # Your WordPress sites
└── logs/             # Application logs
```

### The Sites Directory

By default, Herd serves sites from `~/Herd`:

```bash
# Create a new WordPress site
cd ~/Herd
mkdir my-wordpress-site
cd my-wordpress-site

# Site is now available at:
# http://my-wordpress-site.test
```

### PHP Version Management

Herd allows instant PHP version switching:

1. **Global PHP Version**: Set default for all sites
2. **Per-Site Isolation**: Different PHP for each project
3. **Command Line**: Consistent with site version

```bash
# Check current PHP version
herd php --version

# List available versions
herd php:list

# Switch global version
herd use php@8.2

# Isolate a site to specific version
cd ~/Herd/my-site
herd isolate php@7.4
```

### Next Steps

Now that you understand Herd's foundation, we'll move on to creating your first WordPress site with proper database configuration and essential services.
