## Course Overview

Your WooCommerce store is slow. You know it, your customers know it, and Google definitely knows it. This checklist isn't another "10 tips to speed up WordPress" article â€“ it's a battle-tested, systematic approach to achieving sub-second load times.

### The Reality Check

- **53% of mobile users** abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load
- **Every second of delay** costs you 7% in conversions
- **Google uses Core Web Vitals** as a ranking factor
- Your competitors are getting faster while you're reading this

### What Makes This Different

This isn't theory. Every technique here has been tested on real WooCommerce stores doing real revenue. We measure everything, assume nothing, and focus on what actually moves the needle.

### What You'll Master

- **Instant Quick Wins**: Changes that take minutes but shave seconds
- **Database Surgery**: Remove years of accumulated junk
- **Image Optimization**: Serve the right size, format, and quality
- **Caching Strategies**: From browser to server to CDN
- **Core Web Vitals**: Pass Google's performance tests
- **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Keep it fast forever

### Prerequisites

- Access to your WordPress admin panel
- FTP/SSH access (for some optimizations)
- Basic understanding of WordPress
- Ability to backup your site (always backup first!)

### Tools You'll Need

- GTmetrix or PageSpeed Insights account
- Image optimization tool (we'll recommend free ones)
- Text editor for code changes
- Patience and coffee

### Expected Results

Following this checklist completely, you should achieve:
- **50-70% reduction** in page load time
- **90+ scores** on PageSpeed Insights
- **Passing Core Web Vitals** scores
- **Increased conversions** (typically 15-30%)

Let's stop talking about speed and start achieving it.
