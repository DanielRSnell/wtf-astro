## Course Overview

Gutenberg blocks usually suck. They're either too basic (core blocks) or too bloated (most block plugins). Greenshift is different â€“ it's powerful enough for agencies but fast enough for performance zealots. This guide shows you how to build impressive sites without the typical block builder baggage.
