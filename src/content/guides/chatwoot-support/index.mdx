## Course Overview

Your support system is a joke. Customers email into the void. Your team uses Gmail as a ticket system. Response times are measured in days. And somehow, you're considering paying Zendesk $300/month to make it slightly less terrible.

Stop. Chatwoot gives you enterprise-grade support capabilities without the enterprise price tag. Self-hosted, feature-rich, and actually designed for teams that care about customers.

### The Support Crisis

Here's your current "system":
- **Email**: Lost in spam, no tracking, no collaboration
- **Contact Forms**: One-way communication black holes
- **Social Media**: Scattered conversations across platforms
- **Phone**: Untracked, unrecorded, unmeasured
- **Live Chat**: That widget that never actually works

Result? Angry customers, stressed team, lost revenue.
