## Course Overview

You're spending 3+ hours daily on repetitive tasks. Copy-pasting order data. Manually sending tracking emails. Updating inventory across platforms. Generating the same reports. It's not running a business – it's expensive data entry.

N8N changes everything. This self-hosted automation platform connects your WordPress/WooCommerce store to... everything. And unlike Zapier, you own it, control it, and pay nothing per task.

### The Automation Reality

Here's what you're doing manually that should be automated:
- **Order Processing**: From payment to fulfillment to tracking
- **Inventory Sync**: Across WooCommerce, Amazon, eBay, your warehouse
- **Customer Communication**: Welcome series, abandoned carts, win-backs
- **Reporting**: Daily sales, inventory alerts, performance metrics
- **Content Management**: Product updates, pricing changes, SEO optimization
