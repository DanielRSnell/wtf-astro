## Course Overview

Your WordPress site makes 200+ database queries per page load. Each query is a speed killer. Page caching helps the homepage, but what about logged-in users? Admin panels? Dynamic content? That's where Redis Object Cache Pro comes in â€“ the difference between "kinda fast" and "holy shit that's fast."

### The Database Problem

Every WordPress page load:
- **Queries options table**: 50-100 times
- **Loads user meta**: 20-30 queries
- **Checks transients**: Another 10-20 hits
- **Plugin queries**: 50-200 more
- **Result**: 3-5 second load times

Page caching can't fix this. CDNs can't fix this. Only object caching can.

### Why Redis + Object Cache Pro

**Redis** is an in-memory data store that's:
- **100x faster** than MySQL for key-value operations
- **Persistent** across restarts (unlike Memcached)
- **Atomic** operations prevent race conditions
- **Scalable** to millions of operations per second

**Object Cache Pro** makes Redis work with WordPress:
- **Drop-in replacement** for WordPress object cache
- **Compression** reduces memory usage by 70%
- **Igbinary serialization** for faster processing
- **Analytics** to see exactly what's being cached
- **Reliability features** prevent cache stampedes
